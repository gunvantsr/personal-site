Finally, a blog.

It was sitting on my to-do list for quite a long period of time. to have a personal blog. though this is not the first time I’m writing something technical. I used to have a tech blog in my native language, under the title of tech4marathi. it’s now inactive. the first post on tech4arathi dates to 10 Feb 2014. At that time, I was in the second semester of my computer science degree program. The idea and inspiration came from several Blogspot, and WordPress sites that I used to follow and read. Most of them are now either lost, vanished, or simply stopped existing. It was pre-social media days, long before algorithm-driven media giants completely altered the way we consume information online. On tech4marathi, my primary focus was on writing about those cool free software, interesting facts, and some how-tos. I wanted to express myself, in mothertounge, about the thing which I found fascinating on the internet. The blog lived a short amount of time. I got really busy with assignments, practicals, and occasional existing crises.

It was not until I graduated from college and moved to another city for a job, I started expressing myself on the internet. I used to write a lot of things on my facebook page, ranging from politics, movies, social movements, and some sad poems. Throughout the time, writing or simply articulating my thoughts around things helped me immensely in multiple ways.

On this blog, I want to continue that long-abounded hobby of simply articulating my own thoughts about tech things. It will be more of personal notes, rants, and essays form rather than draw the rest of the fucking owl kinda tutorials. Internet is already filled with them. Also, English is not my first language, so there will always be space for grammatical corrections and improvements.
