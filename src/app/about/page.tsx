      <p className="pt-5 ">
        i was born and raised in a tiny village in the mahrashtra region, where
        i came across this magic box called computers in my high school. i spent
        my teenage doing several odd jobs. sometimes in the local forest
        department and at construction sites. then i finally got a job at an
        internet cafe, which required me to travel a few km daily, but provided
        me something that i was curiousâ€‹ about: unrestricted access to pc and
        the internet! its the time, when i taught myself to build webpages using
        html, css, and dreamweaver cs6. it felt nice, to build webpage layouts
        using html tables!

        i went to mgm's college where i graduated with a bachelor's in computer
        science. during my college days, again, i spent most of my in computer
        labs (yeah, for fast internet!). i was privileged enough to be
        surrounded by professors who encouraged me to pursue my intellectual
        curiosities. i tinkered around with web development, wrote some python
        scripts, and listened unhealthy amount of old bollywood songs.
